# Water-Quality-Detection-System

## Project Description:
  In this project, the 5 different qualities of water are determined by using different sensors. The pH Value, Turbidity, Depth, CO2 Level, Temperature of water are caluculated and they are transfered and monitored on other system through wireless transmission via Radio Frequency Channel.
